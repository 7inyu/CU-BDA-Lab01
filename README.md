	$ whoami

My name is Qinyu Wang. I am a **Master of Engineering** candidate at **ORIE**, **Cornell University**.

	$ mkdir ~/DataScience

Recently find my passion in playing with `code` and `statistics`. I intend to become a `data scientist`.
	
	$ history 

I have some experience in doing statistical analysis using `Python` and `R`. Through this course, I wish to polish up my coding skills, make my code more readable, consistent, and easier for others to work with.

Bayesian

	$ echo 'What is a Bayesian like?'

Most of my statistics course professors claim to be **Frequentists**. It would be interesting to see a **Bayesian** in its natural habitat.

[Are Bayesians and Frequentists really that different?](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/10/13/as-an-applied-statistician-i-find-the-frequentists-versus-bayesians-debate-completely-inconsequential/)
