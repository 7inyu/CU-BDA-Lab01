I am a first year **Master of Engineering** candidate at **ORIE**, **Cornell University**.\r\n\r\n\t$ mkdir ~/DataScience\r\n\r\nRecently find my passion in playing with `code` and `statistics`. I intend to become a `data scientist`.\r\n\t\r\n\t$ history \r\n\r\nI have some experience in doing statistical analysis using `Python` and `R`. Through this course, I wish to polish up my coding skills, make my code more readable, consistent, and easier for others to work with.\r\n\r\nBayesian\r\n===\r\n\r\n\t$ echo 'What is a Bayesian like?'\r\n\r\nMost of my statistics course professors claim to be **Frequentists**. It would be interesting to see a **Bayesian** in its natural habitat.\r\n\r\n[Are Bayesians and Frequentists really that different?](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/10/13/as-an-applied-statistician-i-find-the-frequentists-versus-bayesians-debate-completely-inconsequential/)\r\n\r\n|    | Bayesian | Frequentist | \r\n|:----------:|:--------:|:-----------:|\r\n|Statistician|yes|yes|\r\n|Respect Data|yes|yes|\r\n\r\nData Analysis Problems\r\n===\r\nOne particular problem I am working on is how to optimize assortment of a supermarket based on its transaction data.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have the transaction data that spans two months and 5 stores of different sizes and locations. It would be interesting to see how customers' behaviors vary between stores.\r\n\r\nDue to non-disclosure agreement I can not share any detailed information about the data, the following is a time series plot of two correlated products' stock in a specific store. I want to find such association rule between products and take advantage of them to optimize assortment.\r\n\r\n![A cute pug in NYC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7inyu/CU-BDA-Lab01/master/stock_plot.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
